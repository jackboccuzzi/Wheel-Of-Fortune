WheelOfFortune.java README.TXT

This program starts by saying "Welcome to Wheel of Fortune!" And tells the user to press
'Enter' to start. After it lets the user know the wheel is spinning and it grabs a movie title and covers all of the character elements with an "*". The programs lets the user know how much the user can win per character guessed correctly. The user is presented with 2 options:

Enter 'A' and try to guess the entire movie phrase, 
OR
Enter 'B' and guess a letter that has not been revealed yet.

If the user selects 'A' and guesses a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the shadow. If the user guesses incorrectly, they will be told it is incorrect and they will be displayed the amount of mistakes they have left before the game ends. Also, if the uses guesses the entire movie phrase from the beginning, 

If the user selects 'B' and guesses the movie phrase correctly, the game will end. If they guess incorrectly, the user will be told that it's an incorrect guess and they will be told how many mistakes they have left. 

The game can end in three ways:

1. You make 3 mistakes (incorrectly guess the letter or movie title)
2. You guess every letter in the phrase
3. You guess the entire movie phrase

After the game is over, regardless if you win or lose, your winnings will be displayed to you (If you lose, you get $0).
